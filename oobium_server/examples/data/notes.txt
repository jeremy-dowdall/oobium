client connects
auto-syncs any changes while connected (bi-di)
last write always recorded
  timestamp, installation
maintains heartbeat

client1 connects to server
  sync: if client1 was the last one to modify the server... nothing to do, right?

each user has a separate file on the server... (separate databases, or a single multi-file database?)
users don't work on a shared pool of data, they each have their own? and they send messages to and from others... hmmm...

bob sends a message to joe:
  bobClient create a message (from: bob, to: joe)
    message is marked to be sent to joe
  bobClient syncs message to server
  bob server sends message to joe server
next time joe client is online, it gets the new message from joe server

live data (single instance data, may be private or shared, with permissions on who can edit and/or delete)
sent data (a message I sent to someone)
received data (a message I received from someone)

lots of replication of data this way..., but everyone has their own copy, like with email and IM

users
installs (device / installation)
groups
