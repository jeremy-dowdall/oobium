files:
 <path> (active journal)
 <path>.init (initial setup as a replicant of another db)
 <path>.sync (replicants: uid, rid and timestamp; 1st line is self)
 <path>.sync.<rid> (deletes since last sync. limit via time and size?)
 <path>.temp (used during compacting)

objects
 database  <name>            (Map<String(id), Model>)
 init      <name>.init       (List<String> -> IdRecord + List<ReplicantIdRecord> + List<DataRecord>)
 repo      <name>.repo       (List<String> -> List<DataRecord> -> List<Model>, compact is a part of this..., Model necessary? I don't think so)
 sync      <name>.sync       (List<String> -> IdRecord + List<ReplicantIdRecord>)
 replicant <name>.sync.<rid> (List<String> -> LastSync + List<DeleteRecord>




IO.File does not exist on web... what are the file doing though?
 List<String>

DbCollection                       IO                                    Web
 create  (collection)              File(path).create
 delete  (collection)              File(path).delete
 getAll  (List<String>)            File(path).readAsStrings()
 get     (String, by ID)           File(path).readAsStrings().findWhere
 putAll  (List<String>, append)    File(path).openWrite(mode: append)...
 put     (String, append)          File(path).writeAsString(mode: append)
 setAll  (List<String>, overwrite) File(path).openWrite(mode: write)...
 set     (String, overwrite)       File(path).writeAsString(mode: write)
